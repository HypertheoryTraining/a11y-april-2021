                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>There are all sorts of strands of creativity that contributed to what we now call electronic music.
                    Even
                    in
                    the
                    19th century, Italian futurists
                    were experimenting with electronically produced sounds. In the 1940's, magnetic audio tape became to
                    be
                    used
                    (abused?) by modifying speed of recording of playback, reversing
                    the tape, and cutting it together from <b>found sounds</b>. In the 1950's the first instances of
                    algorithmically
                    produced sounds - those generated by a computer program, first appeared.

                <h2>Types of Modern Electronic Music</h2>
                <p>Electronic music these days is created using a variety of techniques. One useful distinction is
                    between
                    <b>analog</b> and <b>digitally</b> produced music.
                <dl>
                    <dt>Analog Music</dt>
                    <dd>Analog Music is created by by electronic components (detailed below), that modify, amplify, and
                        filter
                        electronic
                        oscillations that produce the common basis of auditory information.</dd>
                    <dt>Digital Music</dt>
                    <dd>Digital Music is often created by microprocessors <i>simulating</i> the components of analog
                        music
                        production
                        inside of a computer. These computers run software
                        (a DAW) that is designed for the design, sequencing, and arranging of electronic music. </dd>

                <h2>Components of Electronic Music Sound</h2>
                <p>The following is a list of some of the components that make up electronic music:</p>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Oscillators</dt>
                    <dd>Oscillators provide a variety of waveforms. Waveforms are patterns of electronic signal that can
                        be
                        made
                        audible.
